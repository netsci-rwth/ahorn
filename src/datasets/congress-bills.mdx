<Alert type="error">Dataset is not yet available.</Alert>

This is a temporal higher-order network dataset, which here means a sequence of timestamped simplices where each simplex is a set of nodes.
In this dataset, nodes are US Congresspersons and simplices are comprised of the sponsor and co-sponsors of legislative bills put forth in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Timestamps are in days and represent when the bill was introduced.
The dataset was derived from James Fowler's data.
The projected graph is a weighted undirected graph representing how many times each pair of nodes co-appears in a simplex.
We restricted to simplices that consist of at most 25 nodes.
