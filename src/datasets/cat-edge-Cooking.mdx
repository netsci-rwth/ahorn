Hypergraph where nodes are food ingredients, hyperedges are recipes made from combining multiple ingredients and categories indicate cuisine.
Raw data was obtained from the [“What's Cooking?” Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking).

<Alert type="warning">
  In the original dataset, some nodes are repeated within hyperedges. This
  version of the dataset has removed these duplicates.
</Alert>

## Usage

The dataset can be loaded directly in TopoNetX using the following code:

```python
import toponetx as tnx
nodes, edges, metadata = tnx.datasets.load_ahorn("cat-edge-Cooking")
```

## Dataset Statistics

<dl className="not-prose grid gap-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Stat title="Nodes" value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["nodes"])} />
  <Stat title="Node Type" value="Ingredient" />
  <Stat
    title="Hyperedges"
    value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["hyperedges"])}
  />
  <Stat title="Hyperedge Type" value="Recipe" />
</dl>

### Edge Labels
