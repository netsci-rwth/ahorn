The MAG-10 network is a subset of the Microsoft Academic Graph where nodes are authors, hyperedges correspond to a publication from those authors, and the hyperedges are categorized by one of 10 computer science confereneces.
If the same set of authors published at more than one conference, we used the most common venue as the category and any cases where there is a tie were discarded.
Papers with more than 25 authors were omitted.

<Alert type="warning">Node 40706 has an erroneous label assignment in the source dataset. We assigned it to the first category.</Alert>
