This is a hypergraph, where nodes are members of the US Senate, and hyperedges correspond to commitee memberships.
The dataset is derived from Congressional data compiled by Charles Stewart and Jonathan Woon.
Each node is labeled with political party affiliation.

<Alert type="warning">
  In the original dataset, some nodes are repeated within hyperedges. This
  version of the dataset has removed these duplicates.
</Alert>
