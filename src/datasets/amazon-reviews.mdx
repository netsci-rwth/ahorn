The amazon-reviews network is a hypergraph where hyperedges are sets of products reviews on Amazon, as collected by Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley (specifically, we use the collection of 5-core datasets).
Nodes are labeled by their product categories.

## Usage

The dataset can be loaded directly in TopoNetX using the following code:

```python
import toponetx as tnx
metadata, nodes, hyperedges = tnx.datasets.load_ahorn("amazon-reviews")
```

## Dataset Statistics

<dl className="not-prose grid gap-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Stat title="Nodes" value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["nodes"])} />
  <Stat title="Node Type" value="Product" />
  <Stat
    title="Hyperedges"
    value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["hyperedges"])}
  />
  <Stat title="Hyperedge Type" value="Co-purchased Products" />
</dl>

### Node Labels

<NodeLabelsChart labels={frontmatter["label-count"]} />
