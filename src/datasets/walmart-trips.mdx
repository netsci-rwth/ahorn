The walmart-trips network is a hypergraph where hyperedges are sets of co-purchased products at Walmart, as released as part of a Kaggle competition.
Products are assigned to one of ten broad departments in which the product appears on walmart.com (e.g., "Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories").
Products not assigned to any of these departments are grouped into an "Other" category.
