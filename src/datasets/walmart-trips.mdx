The walmart-trips network is a hypergraph where hyperedges are sets of co-purchased products at Walmart, as released as part of a Kaggle competition.
Products are assigned to one of ten broad departments in which the product appears on walmart.com (e.g., "Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories").
Products not assigned to any of these departments are grouped into an "Other" category.

## Usage

The dataset can be loaded directly in TopoNetX using the following code:

```python
import toponetx as tnx
nodes, edges, metadata = tnx.datasets.load_ahorn("walmart-trips")
```

## Dataset Statistics

<dl className="not-prose grid gap-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Stat title="Nodes" value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["nodes"])} />
  <Stat title="Node Type" value="Product" />
  <Stat
    title="Hyperedges"
    value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["hyperedges"])}
  />
  <Stat title="Hyperedge Type" value="Co-purchased Products" />
</dl>

### Node Labels

<NodeLabelsChart labels={frontmatter["label-count"]} />
