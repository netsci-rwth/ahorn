This is a hypergraph, where nodes are members of the US House of Representatives and hyperedges correspond to committee memberships.
The dataset is derived from Congressional data compiled by Charles Stewart and Jonathan Woon.
Each node is labeled with political party affiliation.

<Alert type="warning">
  In the original dataset, some nodes are repeated within hyperedges. This
  version of the dataset has removed these duplicates.
</Alert>

## Usage

The dataset can be loaded directly in TopoNetX using the following code:

```python
import toponetx as tnx

nodes, hyperedges = tnx.datasets.load_benson_hyperedges("house-committees")
```
