This is a hypergraph, where nodes are US Congresspersons and hyperedges are comprised of the sponsor and co-sponsors of bills put forth in the Senate.
Some hyperedges are repeated.
The dataset was derived from James Fowler's data.
Each node is labeled with political party affiliation.

## Usage

The dataset can be loaded directly in TopoNetX using the following code:

```python
import toponetx as tnx

nodes, hyperedges = tnx.datasets.load_benson_hyperedges("senate-bills")
```

## Dataset Statistics
