<Alert type="error">Dataset is not yet available.</Alert>

The stackoverflow-answers network is a hypergraph where hyperedges are sets of questions answered by users on Stack Overflow.
Nodes are labeled by the tags used in the questions, and nodes often have multiple labels.

## Usage

The dataset can be loaded directly in TopoNetX using the following code:

```python
import toponetx as tnx
metadata, nodes, hyperedges = tnx.datasets.load_ahorn("stackoverflow-answers")
```

## Dataset Statistics

<dl className="not-prose grid gap-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Stat title="Nodes" value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["nodes"])} />
  <Stat title="Node Type" value="Question" />
  <Stat
    title="Hyperedges"
    value={formatNumber(frontmatter["shape"]["hyperedges"])}
  />
  <Stat title="Hyperedge Type" value="Co-answered Questions" />
</dl>
