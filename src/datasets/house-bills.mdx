This is a hypergraph, where nodes are US Congresspersons and hyperedges are comprised of the sponsor and co-sponsors of bills put forth in the House of Representatives.
Some hyperedges are repeated.
The dataset was derived from James Fowler's data.
Each node is labeled with political party affiliation.
