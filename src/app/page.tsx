        <h2>What is AHORN?</h2>
        <p>
          AHORN is a repository of higher-order network datasets, providing
          researchers with access to a wide range of resources for their
          studies. It is designed to facilitate research and development in the
          field of higher-order networks by offering a variety of datasets that
          can be used for benchmarking, testing algorithms, and exploring new
          concepts in network science.
        </p>

        <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
        <p>
          AHORN was introduced at the{" "}
          <a href="https://conf.netsci.rwth-aachen.de/">
            Higher Order Opportunities and Challenges
          </a>{" "}
          workshop, which took place from the 11th to the 13th of August 2025 in
          Aachen, Germany. The repository is currently under development, and we
          are actively working on expanding the dataset collection and improving
          the user experience.{" "}
          <b>We welcome contributions from the community</b>, including dataset
          submissions, feedback, and suggestions for improvement.
