## I. Provision of the website and generation of log files

### a) Description and scope of data processing

Each connection to this website requires a technical exchange of information between your device – for example your computer, tablet or mobile phone – and the server on which this website is hosted, in order to allow communication between this website and your device.
Upon each connection to this website, process data are stored in a log file on the server hosted by the FH Aachen IT services. These data may specifically include:

- Date and time of access.
- The IP address of the user.
- Name of requested files.
- Whether a connection was successful.
- Information on the browser and version used.
- Information on the operating system of the user.
- The internet service provider of the user.
- Websites from which the user's system is led to this website.
- Information on websites visited and files opened.

This information is used for the continued operation of the website, i.e. for the identification, limitation and correction of disruptions or errors.

In addition, the log data is processed for technical security, in particular to protect against and defend against cyber attacks. This is done on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. e), 32 para. 1 GDPR.

### b) Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for storing technical communication data and log files follows from Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. e), para. 3 GDPR in conjunction with §3 (1) DSG NRW in conjunction with §3 HG NRW.

### c) Deletion of Data and Duration of Storage

The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for carrying out the purpose of its collection. Typically, data is deleted seven days after its storage at the latest. It is possible that the data is stored for a longer period. In this case, the user's IP address is deleted or anonymized, so that the client accessing the website can no longer be identified.

## II. Use of cookies

This website does not make use of cookies.

## III. Rights of the person concerned

If personal data is processed by the data subject, he/she has the following rights vis-à-vis the controller.
Pursuant to Article 15 et seq. GDPR, the data subject has the right of access to the personal data concerned, the right to rectification or erasure or restriction of processing, the right to object to processing and the right to data portability. In accordance with Article 77 GDPR, he/she also has the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority (https://www.ldi.nrw.de/kontakt) if the data subject is of the opinion that the processing of personal data concerning him/her violates this regulation. If the processing is based on the consent of the data subject (see Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a), Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a) GDPR), he/she also has the right to withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; this will only take effect for the future.

To exercise the aforementioned rights, the data subject should send an email to schaub@cs.rwth-aachen.de.
