# About

The Aachen Higher-Order Repository of Networks (AHORN) aims to provide a comprehensive collection of higher-order network datasets, particularly focusing on simplicial complexes, cell complexes and hypergraphs.
This repository is designed to facilitate research and development in the field of higher-order networks by offering a variety of datasets that can be used for benchmarking, testing algorithms, and exploring new concepts in network science.

The project is similar in spirit to graph repositories like [ICON](https://icon.colorado.edu/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/), and [Netzschleuder](https://networks.skewed.de/) but specifically tailored for higher-order datasets.

## Licensing

- Not all licenses will allow us to distribute third-party datasets on our site
  - Sometimes distribution may be allowed, but alternation (our own data format!) may be disallowed.
