# Dataset Converter

Each dataset in this project is accompanied by a parser that takes the raw dataset and converts it into our [dataset format](/about/format).
The parsers are implemented in Python.

<Alert type="warning">
  TODOs: - Give guidelines when to produce a `.txt` and when to produce a
  `.txt.gz` file.
</Alert>

## Validation

We provide a validation script that checks if the dataset conforms to the expected format.
This script can be used to ensure that the dataset is correctly formatted and ready for use.
Any new dataset MUST pass the validation script before it can be included in the repository.

```bash
uv run validate.py PATH_TO_DATASET
```
