# Contributing Guidelines

## Add a Dataset

We welcome contributions of high-quality datasets to the AHORN repository.
To add a dataset, please follow these steps:

1. Write a [converter](/about/dataset-converter) that converts the dataset into [our format](/about/format).
   You need to contribute the converter code to the project.
2. Write a [datasheet](/about/datasheet) describing the dataset, including:
   - Dataset origin and collection process.
   - Licensing and usage restrictions, if applicable.
   - Known issues or limitations.
   - Recommended citation.
3. Ensure your dataset and code comply with all relevant licenses and ethical guidelines.
4. Open a pull request with:
   - The converter code
   - The datasheet
   - The dataset (or a script to download/process it, if redistribution is not allowed)
   - Any relevant documentation or usage examples
5. Respond to code review and feedback from maintainers.

## Code Style

- Python: ruff, black (PEP8 compliant)
- JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, MDX: prettier
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments and docstrings where appropriate

## General Guidelines

- **Respect privacy and copyright:** Do not submit data you do not have the right to share.
- **Test your code:** Ensure your converter runs without errors and produces valid output.
- **Documentation:** Update or add documentation as needed for new datasets or features.
- **Communication:** If in doubt, open an issue or discussion before submitting a large contribution.
- **Attribution:** Credit original data sources and authors where required.

## Review Process

- All contributions are reviewed by maintainers.
- We may request changes or clarifications before merging.
- Datasets may be rejected if they do not meet quality, legal, or ethical standards.

Thank you for helping to build a high-quality, open resource for the higher-order network community!
