# `ahorn-loader`

`ahorn-loader` is both a command-line tool and a Python package designed to interact with the AHORN dataset repository.
It allows users to easily download datasets and loading them into Python for analysis and experimentation.
It is also home of our [validation script](/about/dataset-converter) to check the correctness of a dataset before publishing it.

## Command-line Usage

To install and use `ahorn-loader` from the command line, you can run the following command:

```bash
uvx ahorn-loader [command] [args]
```

Commands include:

- `ls`: List available datasets in AHORN.
- `download`: Download a dataset from AHORN.
- `validate`: Validate a specific dataset file (e.g., before adding it to AHORN).

To get a full help of available commands and options, run `ahorn-loader --help`.

## Python Package Usage

You can install `ahorn-loader` as a Python package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ahorn-loader/) via `pip` (or some other package manager of your choice):

```bash
pip install ahorn-loader
```

Then, you can use it in your Python scripts:

```python
import ahorn_loader

# Download a dataset:
ahorn_loader.download_dataset("dataset_name", "target_path")

# Download and read a dataset:
# The dataset will be stored in your system's cache. For a more permanent storage
# location, use `ahorn_loader.download_dataset` instead.
with ahorn_loader.read_dataset("dataset_name") as dataset:
    for line in dataset:
        ...

# Validate a specific dataset (e.g., before adding it to AHORN):
ahorn_loader.validate("path_to_dataset_file")
```
