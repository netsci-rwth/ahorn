  <span>Dataset Format</span>

</h1>

All datasets distributed in this project follow a standardized format to ensure consistency and ease of use.
If you use [TopoNetX](https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoNetX), you can load all datasets in this repository directly using the provided functions.

Design goals of the dataset format:

- **Human-readable**: Plain text format with optional compression.
- **Interoperable**: Easy to parse and use in different programming languages.
- **Flexible**: Next to some standardized metadata, the format allows for custom dataset-specific attributes.

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Example

Before giving the formal specification, here is a minimal example of a dataset in the described format:

```plain
{"name": "example-dataset", "more-dataset-metadata": "value", "_format-version": "0.1", "_revision": 1}
1 {"name": "John Doe", "age": 28}
1,2,5 {"time": "2023-01-01T07:42:45+00:00", "weight": 1.0, "other-data": "value"}
4,2,1 {"time": "2023-01-02T19:13:09+00:00", "weight": 2.5}
```

**Explanation:**

- The first line contains dataset-level metadata as a JSON object, including a name and format version.
- The network has four nodes: `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5`:
  - Node `1` has an attribute `name` with value `John Doe`, and an attribute `age` with value `28`.
  - Nodes `2`, `4`, and `5` are defined implicitly by their appearance in the edges.
- The third and fourth lines define two hyperedges:
  - The first edge connects nodes `1`, `2`, and `5`, and has attributes `time`, `weight`, and a custom `other-data`.
  - The second edge connects nodes `4`, `2`, and `1`, and has attributes `time` and `weight`.

## Structure

The dataset is a plain or gzipped text file with the following structure:

- The first line MAY contain dataset-level metadata in JSON format.
- Afterwards, there is a section for nodes, where each node is defined on a separate line.
- Following the nodes, there are lines for edges (hyperedges or simplices), where each line contains a comma-separated list of node identifiers.

Some datasets in AHORN contain multiple networks (e.g., different molecules) in a single file.
In that case, each network begins with a marker line that contains the network-level metadata as a JSON object.
The marker line is followed by the node and edge definitions for that network.
The dataset-level metadata MUST list the number of networks in the `_num-networks` attribute.

```plain
{"_num-networks": 2, "_format-version": "0.2", "_revision": 2}
{"id":"network-001", "label": "toxic"}
1 {"feat": [0.1, 0.2]}
2 {"feat": [0.0, 0.3]}
1,2 {"weight": 1.0}
{"id":"network-002", "label": "non-toxic"}
a {"feat": [0.5, 0.4]}
b {"feat": [0.6, 0.1]}
a,b {"weight": 2.0}
```

## Nodes

Nodes (vertices) MUST be integers (non-consecutive) or strings (e.g., names), but MUST NOT contain commas or other special characters.
In general, nodes are defined implicitly by their appearance in edges, but can be explicitly defined if they have attributes or are unconnected.

<Alert type="info">For some datasets, nodes are numbered but get assigned a unique name as attribute, e.g., `{"name": "John Doe"}`. This makes the edge definitions simpler and more compact.</Alert>

## Edges

<Alert type="info">
  AHORN is a repository for higher-order networks. For brevity, we use the term
  “edge” in this specification to refer to simplices, cells, or hyperedges depending on whether the
  network is a simplicial complex, cell complex, or hypergraph. Different to a
  graph, edges in our case can connect more than two nodes.
</Alert>

- Each line represents a (hyper-)edge or simplex; the nodes in the edge are separated by a comma
- The edge line MAY contain attributes in JSON format at the end of the line.

## Attributes

Any element (including the dataset itself) in the dataset MAY be equipped with attributes that provide additional information.
Attributes are stored as key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value can be of arbitrary type.
They are encoded as JSON objects in the dataset file and are placed at the end of the line for each node or edge.
Some attributes have standardized meanings, while others can be custom-defined for specific datasets.

Attribute names SHOULD be lowercase and use dashes to separate words, e.g., `time`, `party`, `class-subject`.
Names SHOULD be descriptive and meaningful, avoiding abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely recognized.
Generic names like `label` or `data` do not convey specific information about the attribute.

The following sections describe standardized attributes that are commonly used in higher-order networks.
If an attribute has a standardized meaning, it MUST be used as described below.
Attribute names starting with an underscore (`_`) are always reserved and MUST only be used for metadata according to this specification.

### Weights

- The `weight` attribute, if present, MUST be an integer or floating-point number that represents the weight of the edge.
- If only some edges are weighted, the `weight` attribute for all other edges SHOULD be present and set to `1.0`.

### Timestamps

<Alert type="info">
  In Python, it is recommended to read timestamps using
  [`date.fromisoformat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.fromisoformat)
  and
  [`datetime.fromisoformat()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromisoformat).
</Alert>

- For temporal datasets, each edge has a `time` attribute.
- Time MUST be formatted as [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) string and MAY include a time, e.g., `2025-02-04` or `2023-01-01T04:45:00+00:00`.
- The time zone MUST be specified and taken from the original dataset.

## Note on Network Type

AHORN collects various types of higher-order networks, including simplicial complexes, cell complexes, and hypergraphs.
The format does not enforce a specific network type, and it is up to you in which way you want to interpret the data.
We provide the datasets in a “minimal” form, that is, any nodes, simplices, or cells that can be inferred from existing data are not included, unless they have attributes.

## Versioning

The published datasets are versioned to ensure reproducibility and track changes over time.
The dataset-level metadata MUST include the `_revision` attribute, which is an integer that indicates the version of the dataset.
When a dataset is updated or modified, the `_revision` number MUST be incremented by one.

## Changelog

  <summary className="cursor-pointer select-none">Version 0.2</summary>
  <div>
    - **Support for dataset revisions**: Added the `_revision` attribute in the dataset-level metadata to track dataset versions. The revision number is increased with each update of the dataset.
    - **Support for multi-network datasets**: Added the ability to include multiple networks in a single dataset file, each with its own metadata.
    - The `name` attribute in the dataset-level metadata is now mandatory. Before it sometimes was called `network-name`.
    - Clarified the usage of reserved attribute names starting with an underscore (`_`).
