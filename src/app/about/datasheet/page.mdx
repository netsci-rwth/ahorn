# Datasheet Page

Each dataset is represented by a `.mdx` file in the `src/datasets` directory.
This page should list all details about the dataset, including its description, usage, and statistics.
Think of this page as a datasheet as outlined in the [Datasheets for Datasets](https://doi.org/10.1145/345872) article.

## Computed Data

In general, inferred data should be stored in the frontmatter of the document, where is can be easily written and read by different components of the project.
Inside the text, the frontmatter is accessible via the `frontmatter` variable.

## Frontmatter

Required fields in the frontmatter:

- `title`: The title of the dataset.
- `source`: A link to the original source of the dataset. If possible, this should be a link to the dataset description page, not a deeplink to the dataset file.

Optional fields that are automatically used when present:

- `citation`: One or more BibTex entries that should be cited when using the dataset.
- `tags`: A list of tags that describe the dataset. These are used for filtering datasets in the UI.

## Attributes

- All attributes appearing in the dataset must be listed on the dataset page.
- Non-standardized attributes must be described in the text.

## Statistics

### Charts

#### Label Distribution

For datasets with labeled nodes, we provide a chart that shows the distribution of labels.

```javascript
import NodeLabelsChart from "@/components/chart/node-labels";
<NodeLabelsChart labels={frontmatter["label-count"]} />;
```

import NodeLabelsChart from "@/components/chart/node-labels";

<NodeLabelsChart
  labels={{
    "Label A": 10,
    "Label B": 14,
    "Label C": 6,
    "Label D": 1,
  }}
/>

#### Shape

For time-evolving simplicial complexes, we provide a chart that shows the number of simplices over time.
The chart is interactive and allows aggregating the shape by different time intervals.

```javascript
import TemporalShapeChart from "@/components/chart/temporal-shape";
<TemporalShapeChart shape={frontmatter.shape} minUnit="hour" maxUnit="week" />;
```

import TemporalShapeChart from "@/components/chart/temporal-shape";

<TemporalShapeChart
  shape={{
    "2023-01-01 04:45:00": [1, 2, 3],
    "2023-01-01 06:23:00": [4, 12, 6],
    "2023-01-01 08:00:00": [7, 8, 9],
    "2023-01-01 09:30:00": [5, 3, 11],
    "2023-01-01 10:45:00": [2, 6, 10],
    "2023-01-01 12:00:00": [3, 4, 8],
    "2023-01-01 13:15:00": [6, 7, 9],

    "2023-01-02 12:45:00": [3, 5, 7],
